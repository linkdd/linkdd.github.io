I'm an autodidact software developer since 2005, with a high interest in
**Cloud Computing**, **Automation**, and building softwares that are
**easy to setup** and **easy to use**.

I believe in **Open Source**, **[stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy)**
and people's potential for the best.

I am currently working on:

 - [Kubirds](https://kubirds.com): A Cloud-Native supervision engine
 - [Datapio](https://datapio.co): A complete CI/CD platform
 - *Letlang*: functional programming language
